## Resolver

Retrieve an unresolved result:

```js
const raw = index.search("a short query", { 
    resolve: false
});
```

You can apply and chain different resolver methods to the raw result, e.g.:

```js
raw.and( ... )
   .and( ... )
   .boost(2)
   .or( ... ,  ... )
   .limit(100)
   .xor( ... )
   .not( ... )
   // final resolve
   .resolve({
       limit: 10,
       offset: 0,
       enrich: true
   });
```

The default resolver:

```js
const raw = index.search("a short query", { 
    resolve: false
});
const result = raw.resolve();
```

Alternatively you can create a `Resolver` by passing an initial query:

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const raw = new Resolver({
    // pass the index is required when query was set
    index: index,
    query: "a short query"
});
const result = raw.resolve();
```

### Chainable Boolean Operations

The basic concept explained:

```js
// 1. get one or multiple unresolved results
const raw1 = index.search("a short query", { 
    resolve: false
});
const raw2 = index.search("another query", {
    resolve: false,
    boost: 2
});

// 2. apply and chain resolver operations
const raw3 = raw1.and(raw2, /* ... */);
// you can access the aggregated result by raw3.result
console.log("The aggregated result is:", raw3.result)
// apply further operations ...

// 3. resolve final result
const result = raw3.resolve({
    limit: 100,
    offset: 0
});
console.log("The final result is:", result)
```

Chain operations and nest inline queries:

```js
const result = index.search("further query", {
    // set resolve to false on the first query
    resolve: false,
    // boost the first query
    boost: 2
})
.or({
    // nested expression
    and: [{
        query: "a query"
    },{
        query: "another query"
    }]
})
.not({
    query: "some query"
})
// resolve the result
.resolve({
    limit: 100,
    offset: 0
});
```

Alternatively you can create a `Resolver` by passing an initial query:

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const result = new Resolver({
    // pass the index is required when query was set
    index: index,
    query: "further query",
    boost: 2
})
.or({
    and: [{
        query: "a query"
    },{
        // you can bind a different index for this
        // query when IDs are from same source
        index: index,
        query: "another query"
    }]
})
.not({
    index: index,
    query: "some query"
})
.resolve({
    limit: 100,
    offset: 0
});
```

When all queries are made against the same index, you can skip the index in every resolver stage followed after initially calling `new Resolve({ index: ... })`:

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const result = new Resolver({
    index: index,
    query: "a query"
})
.and({ query: "another query" })
.or ({ query: "further query", boost: 2 })
.not({ query: "some query" })
.resolve(100);
```

### Using Cached Queries

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const result = new Resolver({
    index: index,
    query: "a query",
    cache: true
})
.and({ 
    query: "another query",
    cache: true
})
.resolve(100);
```

## Async Resolver

### Using Async Queries (incl. Runtime Balancer)

All async tasks will run in parallel, balanced by the runtime observer:

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const resolver = new Resolver({
    index: index,
    query: "a query",
    async: true
})
.and({ 
    query: "another query",
    async: true
})
.or({
    query: "some query",
    async: true
});
const result = await resolver.resolve(100);
```

### Queuing Async Queries

All queued tasks will run consecutively, also balanced by the runtime observer:

```js
import { Resolver } from "flexsearch";
const resolver = await new Resolver({
    index: index,
    query: "a query",
    async: true
})
.and({ 
    query: "another query",
    queue: true
})
.or({
    query: "some query",
    queue: true
})
.resolve(100);
```

When tasks are processed consecutively, it will skip specific resolver stages when there is no result expected.

### Compare Parallel VS. Consecutive

When using the parallel workflow, all resolver stages will send their requests (including nested tasks) to the DB immediately and calculate the results in the right order as soon as the request resolves. When the overall workload of your applications has some free resources, a parallel request workflow improves performance compared to the consecutive counterpart.

---

When using the consecutive workflow, all resolver stages will send their requests (including nested tasks) to the DB only when the previous request resolves. The advantage of this variant is when a stage becomes invalid because of the previous result, it can skip the request completely and continue with the next stage. This can reduce the overall workload.

### Custom Resolver

```js
function CustomResolver(raw){
    // console.log(raw)
    let output;
    // generate output ...
    return output;
}

const result = index.search("a short query", { 
    resolve: CustomResolver
});
```
